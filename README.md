# EcoSync

EcoSync is a project developed for CodeSamurai - 2024 phase 2, aimed at revolutionizing solid waste management in the bustling city of Dhaka, particularly under the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC). With the city's economic significance and millions of residents' dreams at stake, EcoSync endeavors to redefine waste management through innovative approaches and collaborative efforts.

## Project Description

The DNCC, recognizing the pressing challenges of solid waste management, has initiated multi-pronged efforts to address inefficiencies in domestic waste collection and explore pioneering initiatives such as waste-to-energy conversions in collaboration with international partners. EcoSync stands as a testament to this visionary approach, aiming to bring about significant improvements in Dhaka's waste management landscape.
